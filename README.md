# Physical-activity-monitoring-project
Smartphone-based activity monitoring using accelerometer data to classify physical actions like walking, running, and standing. Achieved 91% accuracy using time-series features (mean, std, entropy, FFT) and ML models. Relevant for sports performance and human motion analysis.

# Future Work

- Integration with mobile application UI
- Real-time streaming and model inference
- Expansion to gyroscope and magnetometer-based multi-sensor fusion

# Relevance

This project builds a solid foundation for analyzing human motion and supports advanced applications in sports performance optimizationâ€”directly aligning with predictive modeling in swimming biomechanics and movement segmentation.
